# Code of Conduct

---

## Our Standards

This project is committed to providing a respectful, professional environment for all contributors.

**Expected behavior includes:**

- Engage constructively and professionally
- Accept governance constraints without attempting scope expansion
- Support human-in-the-loop safeguards
- Respect survivor-centered governance authority
- Acknowledge this framework's pilot-only status

---

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are not permitted:

- Advocacy for surveillance expansion
- Proposals enabling predictive policing
- Attempts to weaken human oversight requirements
- Disrespectful or harassing communication
- Misrepresentation of the framework's pilot-only status
- Scope expansion proposals disguised as improvements

---

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for reviewing contributions against:

- R4.2.3-FINAL guardrail DNA
- Governance non-expansion requirements
- Survivor-board authority provisions
- Human-in-the-loop preservation requirements

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct or the project's binding constraints.

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all repository spaces, issues, pull requests, and discussions.

---

## Enforcement

Instances of non-compliance may result in:

- Contribution rejection
- Removal of contribution privileges
- Reporting to appropriate governance bodies (if applicable)

**This framework does not operate as an enforcement system and this Code of Conduct does not create new authority beyond repository governance.**

---

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from standard open source governance principles, aligned with the OCTOPUS Framework's survivor-centered, rights-first posture.

**Guardrail DNA:** R4.2.3-FINAL (Frozen / PASS)
