# Contributing to the OCTOPUS Framework

---

**Guardrail DNA:** R4.2.3-FINAL  
**Status:** Pilot Proposal Only — Not an Operational System  

---

## 1. Project Scope

The OCTOPUS Framework is a **governance-constrained, survivor-centered pilot proposal**.  

**It is NOT:**
- A surveillance system
- A predictive policing tool
- An operational enforcement platform
- A database management system
- An investigative authority
- A monitoring or tracking system

All contributions must preserve this scope without expansion.

---

## 2. Non-Expansion Rule

**No contribution may:**

- Create new investigative authority
- Expand jurisdiction
- Enable surveillance of individuals or communities
- Introduce risk scoring or profiling
- Introduce predictive policing logic
- Enable automated enforcement
- Enable automated referral to law enforcement
- Introduce biometric systems (facial recognition, fingerprinting, etc.)
- Introduce bulk data ingestion
- Introduce evidentiary media ingestion or storage
- Enable cross-linkage of intake streams by default
- Remove or weaken human-in-the-loop requirements
- Reduce survivor governance authority

**If a proposed change introduces any of the above, it will be rejected.**

---

## 3. Human-in-the-Loop Requirement

All escalation, routing, referral, prioritization, and information-sharing actions must remain subject to **documented human review and authorization**.

No automation of enforcement decisions is permitted.

---

## 4. Contribution Process

### Before Contributing:

1. **Review these documents:**
   - `README.md` — Framework overview and binding constraints
   - `SURVIVOR-BOARD.md` — Governance authority structure
   - `SURVIVOR-DIGNITY-COVENANT.md` — Consent and revocability principles
   - `MISUSE-CLAUSE.md` — Prohibited uses
   - `ARCHITECTURE-STATUS.md` — System status and limitations

2. **Confirm your proposed change does NOT:**
   - Expand scope
   - Introduce new capabilities
   - Weaken existing guardrails
   - Create operational system components

### Submitting Changes:

1. Open an issue using the **Proposed Change** template
2. Complete all required guardrail compliance checkboxes
3. Submit for survivor board review (if structural)
4. Only proceed with implementation after approval

### Pull Request Requirements:

## 6. What We Reject

## 7. Reporting Misuse

If you observe a contribution or proposal that violates the guardrail constraints or misrepresents the framework, please report it to:

**Email:** [octopus-governance@bwrgroup.ca](mailto:octopus-governance@bwrgroup.ca)

## 8. Governance Authority

Final decisions on structural changes rest with the **survivor board** as defined in `SURVIVOR-BOARD.md`.

This repository does not grant contributors authority to expand scope, introduce new capabilities, or override governance constraints.

**Thank you for respecting the boundaries of this framework.**
