# Survivor Dignity Covenant
Octopus Framework – Survivor Authority & Protection Commitment

Octopus exists because survivors exist.

Survivors are not subjects.
Survivors are not data sources.
Survivors are not case studies.

Survivors are the authority.

## Core Principles

1. Participation must be voluntary.
2. Consent must be informed and documented.
3. Consent must be revocable at any time without penalty.
4. Survivor narratives must be anonymized prior to any system intake.
5. No identifiable fragments may be released.
6. Survivor Blueprints may not be combined with external datasets for enrichment or profiling.
7. No secondary use without additional consent or lawful authority.

## Governance Requirements

Any adaptation of this framework must include:

- At least two survivor-representative seats on governance boards.
- Survivor veto authority over changes to Blueprint methodology.
- Transparent audit mechanisms.
- Clear reporting pathways for ethical violations.

## Absolute Boundaries

This framework SHALL NOT:

- Commercialize survivor trauma.
- Use survivor narratives for marketing.
- Convert survivor data into proprietary assets.
- Use aggregate insights to justify surveillance expansion.
- Weaponize survivor experiences for institutional optics.

## Dignity Standard

Human dignity overrides system efficiency.
Human oversight overrides algorithmic output.
Human consent overrides institutional speed.

Survivors are not inputs.
They are the reason this exists.
