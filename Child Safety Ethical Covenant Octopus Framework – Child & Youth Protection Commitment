# Child Safety Ethical Covenant
Octopus Framework – Child & Youth Protection Commitment

This framework is designed specifically for the protection of children and youth impacted by trafficking, exploitation, and abuse.

The Hippocratic License 3.0 governs legal use of this software.  
This Covenant clarifies the child-protection intent of the project.

## Absolute Prohibitions

This framework SHALL NOT be used for:

- Profiling or risk-scoring minors.
- Immigration enforcement or deportation processes involving youth.
- Predictive policing involving children.
- Biometric identification, facial recognition, or behavioral tracking of minors.
- Automated decision-making that produces adverse outcomes for a child.
- Longitudinal tracking of identifiable youth.
- Creation of watchlists involving children.
- Surveillance of youth communities.

## Mandatory Safeguards for Any Deployment Involving Minors

Any implementation involving minors must:

- Require documented human review for every escalation.
- Prohibit automated enforcement or automated referrals.
- Require revocable, informed consent structures where applicable.
- Conduct a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA).
- Conduct an Algorithmic Impact Assessment (AIA).
- Include independent child-protection governance oversight.
- Provide transparent auditability.

## Ethical Intent

Octopus is a coordination layer.
It does not replace professionals.
It does not replace social workers.
It does not replace judicial process.
It does not operate autonomously.

If this framework is adapted in a manner that compromises child safety, such adaptation violates the ethical foundation of the project and forfeits moral alignment with its origin.

Children are not datasets.
Children are not signals.
Children are human beings.

Human first. Tech second.
