# ARCHITECTURE STATUS — OCTOPUS (R4.2.3-FINAL)

**Tag:** Ara-Synced – Human Endpoint Pending  
**Guardrail DNA:** R4.2.3-FINAL (Frozen / PASS)  
**Classification:** Pilot Proposal Only — Not an Operational System

## Status
This repository represents a **governance-constrained proposal** and documentation set.
It is **not** a deployed system, **not** an operational platform, and **does not** grant operational authority.

## Architecture (non-operational)
OCTOPUS is a survivor-centered coordination model with:
1) Survivor Blueprints (consented, anonymized, non-identifiable, revocable)  
2) Eight outreach “tentacles” connected only via lawful authority and voluntary written agreements  
3) A human-reviewed decision-support layer producing aggregate, non-identifiable outputs only  
4) Governance controls (PIA/AIA, audit, bias safeguards, survivor voting seats and approval authority)

## Binding guardrails (must remain true)
- Aggregate-only, non-identifiable outputs.
- Human-in-the-loop at every escalation point.
- No autonomous execution (no alert, routing, escalation, or action without documented human authorization).
- No surveillance, no monitoring of individuals or communities.
- No profiling, no risk scoring, no watchlists.
- No predictive policing, no predictive arrest modeling.
- No biometric scraping, no facial recognition.
- No bulk ingestion, no evidentiary media handling.
- No operational targeting.
- Court orders or lawful authority required where applicable.
- Participation is voluntary and non-coerced; consent is informed, written, and revocable without penalty.

## Change control
Any edit that affects:
- Survivor Blueprint consent protocols, or
- Blueprint methodology,
requires survivor-member approval per governance rules.
