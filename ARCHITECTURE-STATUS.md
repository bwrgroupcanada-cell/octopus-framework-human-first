Architecture Status

Classification: Governance Framework  
Operational Authority: None  
Deployment Status: Not Deployed  

O.C.T.O.P.U.S. is a coordination layer proposal only.

It does not ingest live operational data.
It does not operate autonomously.
It does not execute enforcement actions.
It does not replace professional judgment.

All architectural references are conceptual and governance-constrained.

Any future deployment would require:

- Independent legal review
- Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)
- Algorithmic Impact Assessment (AIA)
- Survivor governance integration
- Human-in-the-loop enforcement validation
- Public audit transparency

No component authorizes automated action.

Architecture status: Conceptual governance framework only.
