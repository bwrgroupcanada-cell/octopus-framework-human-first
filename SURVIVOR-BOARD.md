# Survivor Governance Board — Structural Authority Framework

Octopus is survivor-centered by design. Governance authority is not symbolic — it is structural.

## 1. Composition

Every official deployment or fork of the Octopus Framework must include:

- Minimum of two (2) voting seats reserved for survivors of trafficking or exploitation.
- Survivors must be selected through independent survivor-led organizations where possible.
- Survivor members must not be token advisors — they hold full voting rights.

## 2. Authority Scope

Survivor Board Members hold binding authority over:

- Any modification to Survivor Blueprint methodology.
- Any changes to consent protocols.
- Any changes affecting anonymization or data handling.
- Any expansion of scope beyond child and youth protection.
- Any change that risks drift toward surveillance, profiling, or automation.

Survivor members hold veto power over the above categories.

A veto cannot be overridden without:
- Unanimous survivor consent, OR
- Formal removal of the fork from official Octopus recognition.

## 3. Approval Record

All material changes must include:
- Written survivor sign-off (email, recorded vote, or signed memo).
- Timestamp of approval.
- Link to the change commit.

No change may be merged without documented survivor acknowledgment.

## 4. Transparency

Each active deployment must:
- Publish governance board membership (unless safety concerns require anonymity).
- Maintain a public-facing governance log.
- Provide a contact method for survivor concerns.

## 5. Ethical Priority Clause

If a technical improvement conflicts with survivor dignity, privacy, or safety:
Survivor dignity overrides system efficiency.

Human first. Tech second.
