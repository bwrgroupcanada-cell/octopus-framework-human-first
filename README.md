## What Octopus Is

Octopus is a survivor-centered coordination framework designed to test whether response latency in child and youth trafficking prevention can be reduced without expanding surveillance, investigative authority, or enforcement powers.

It operates strictly within existing legal authority.

It creates:
- No new investigative powers
- No new data access privileges
- No automated enforcement mechanisms
- No predictive policing capability
- No risk scoring of individuals

AI, where referenced, is limited to aggregate, non-identifiable pattern synthesis for decision-support only.

All outputs require documented human review and authorization.

Humans decide.

## What Octopus Is Not

Octopus is not:

- A surveillance system
- A monitoring platform
- A watchlist generator
- A predictive policing engine
- A biometric tool
- An evidentiary database
- An automated referral mechanism

No autonomous execution is permitted under this framework.

## Governance Principles

- Survivor participation is voluntary, informed, written, and revocable.
- No identifiable data is released.
- Re-identification risk assessment is mandatory prior to release of aggregate outputs.
- Human-in-the-loop at every escalation point.
- No cross-linkage of intake streams by default.
- No secondary use without additional consent or lawful authority.

Human dignity overrides system efficiency.
Human oversight overrides algorithmic output.
Human consent overrides institutional speed.
