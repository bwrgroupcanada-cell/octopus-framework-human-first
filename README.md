# Octopus: Origin-Centered Trauma Outreach Protection Under Survivor Sight

**Human first. Tech second.**

Octopus is a survivor-centered coordination framework for child and youth trafficking prevention.

It is not surveillance.
It is not predictive policing.
It is not automation.
It is not an enforcement tool.
It is not a product.

It is a governance-locked coordination layer.

---

## What This Is

Octopus is a structural framework designed to:

- Reduce response latency through improved human coordination.
- Preserve survivor dignity and consent.
- Prevent institutional drift into surveillance or profiling.
- Ensure human-in-the-loop review at every escalation point.

AI within this framework synthesizes aggregate, non-identifiable patterns only.
Humans make all decisions.

No system component acts autonomously.

---

## What This Is Not

Octopus does NOT:

- Create new investigative powers.
- Expand jurisdiction.
- Assign individual risk scores.
- Monitor communities.
- Conduct biometric scraping.
- Use facial recognition.
- Automate referrals to law enforcement.
- Enable predictive policing.
- Enable mass surveillance.

Any fork that introduces these capabilities is operating outside license authorization.

---

## Governance Structure

Octopus is survivor-governed.

- Minimum two (2) survivor voting seats required in any official deployment.
- Survivor veto required for changes to consent protocols or Blueprint methodology.
- All governance changes must be documented.
- Ethical compliance is enforced under the Hippocratic License 3.0.

See:
- SURVIVOR-BOARD.md
- MISUSE-CLAUSE.md
- AUDIT-LOG.md
- SURVIVOR-DIGNITY-COVENANT.md

If technical optimization conflicts with survivor dignity:
Survivor dignity overrides system efficiency.

## Architecture Overview

Octopus operates through:

1. Survivor Blueprint Phase (Consent-based narrative foundation)
2. Eight restricted integration pathways (“Tentacles”)
3. Human-Reviewed Decision-Support Layer
4. Governance & Non-Expansion Safeguards

All outputs are:
- Aggregate
- Non-identifiable
- Non-persistent
- Decision-support only

There is no operational targeting layer.
There is no profiling logic.
There is no automated enforcement trigger.

This framework exists because children deserve protection without becoming data points.

This is infrastructure for dignity.
