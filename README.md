# OCTOPUS: Origin Centered Trauma Outreach Protection Under Survivor Sight

**Mantra:** Human first. Tech second.

**Tag:** Ara-Synced – Human Endpoint Pending  
**Guardrail DNA:** R4.2.3-FINAL (Frozen / PASS)  
**Classification:** Pilot Proposal Only — Not an Operational System

## What it is
A survivor-centered coordination model **proposed for pilot evaluation** to test whether response latency can be reduced in child and youth trafficking prevention **without** expanding surveillance, investigative authority, or enforcement powers.

AI (where used) synthesizes **aggregate, non-identifiable patterns only** for **decision-support**.  
**Humans authorize all actions.** No component operates autonomously.

## What it is not (binding constraints)
- No new investigative powers created.
- No bulk data ingestion.
- No biometric scraping.
- No facial recognition systems.
- No watchlists.
- No risk scoring of individuals.
- No individual profiling.
- No predictive arrest modeling.
- No predictive policing.
- No mass surveillance.
- No automated referral to law enforcement without human validation.
- No automated enforcement action.
- No evidentiary media ingestion, storage, or management.
- No cross-linkage of intake streams by default.
- No monitoring of individuals or communities.
- No operational targeting.
- Court orders or other lawful authority required where applicable.
- All escalation requires documented human authorization.
- Mandatory human-in-the-loop at every escalation point across every tentacle.
- No autonomous execution: no alert, routing, escalation, or action occurs without documented human authorization.

## Governance (required controls)
- PIPEDA compliance and consent principles.
- Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) prior to deployment.
- Algorithmic Impact Assessment (AIA) prior to deployment.
- Bias testing on training data.
- Explainability requirements for all model outputs.
- Independent audit review.
- Mandatory human-in-the-loop at all escalation points.
- Human reviewers must receive documented training on automation bias; override rates must be audited; no performance metrics may incentivize deference to AI outputs.
- Explicit rejection of predictive policing.
- Explicit rejection of mass surveillance.
- Governance board including legal, privacy, child protection, community representation, and at least one independent member not affiliated with participating agencies.
- At least two voting seats are reserved for survivors selected through independent survivor-led organizations; material changes to Blueprint methodology or consent protocols require survivor-member approval.
